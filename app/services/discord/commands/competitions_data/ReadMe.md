[How to](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OfaL5cD5taL3zLS8jHn0yABqHhskW9Jq?usp=sharing) add new ids from:

1. Find all coins which have the tickers that participants have submitted
2. Filter them by hand to find right ids
3. Get the list of all ids, copy it in this folder name_of_competition.py ; add start and final date
4. Get the participants to check that we fetch their projects by showing them the links
5. When the competition is over, add final results as a string and a link to datapane report

(probably should give permissions to edit the file only to Bot Contributors to avoid hacks since the bot is now public?)
